## 🔍 Challenge and Approach

🧩 Challenge
The internet is flooded with misinformation and fake news, especially on social media platforms. While users may recognize suspicious content, there is often no accessible and credible channel for them to report it and have it verified. Additionally, expert reviewers face challenges in handling large volumes of reports efficiently.





💡 Our Approach
To address this, we built FactBridge, a platform that:

• Enables any user to report suspicious news from social media.

• Uses open-source AI to generate summaries of reported content, helping experts understand the case faster.

• Provides a simple and focused interface for expert reviewers to evaluate cases and mark them as real or fake.

• Summarizes the expert's decision using AI and sends the final result back to social media platforms.

This approach combines crowdsourced reporting, expert review, and AI assistance to streamline the fake news detection process from end to end.
